# scripts

Scripts that I've written.

As follows are a brief description of each script:
* showRenamer.py    Rename tv shows in working directory to match the following format: ShowName_S01E01.
* showRenamer.py    This script does the same as showRenamer.py, but targets differently named files. Should eventually merge with showRenamer.py
* pythonCat         Find the three largest text files in working directory and concatenate them. Contains sample files.
* deduplicator.py   Implement different deduplication methods and perform basic efficiency testing.
* steamTools.py     Find which members of a given list are on Steam.
